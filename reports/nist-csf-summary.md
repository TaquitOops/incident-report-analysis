#  NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Summary

The NIST CSF provides five core functions to manage cybersecurity risks:

1. **Identify** → Regular audits of systems, devices, and access privileges.  
2. **Protect** → Policies, training, encryption, MFA, firewalls, IPS.  
3. **Detect** → IDS, SIEM, anomaly detection, continuous monitoring.  
4. **Respond** → Incident response plans, communication protocols, mitigation steps.  
5. **Recover** → Backup restoration, recovery planning, resilience improvements.
