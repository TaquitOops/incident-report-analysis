#  Incident Report Analysis Repository

This repository contains cybersecurity incident report analyses based on the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.  
It is designed as a portfolio and study resource for documenting real-world scenarios, applying structured security practices, and demonstrating proactive risk management.

---

##  Repository Structure

- **reports/** → Completed incident reports (e.g., DoS attack analysis).
- **templates/** → Reusable templates for creating new incident reports.
- **resources/** → Supporting materials such as NIST CSF summaries and study notes.

##  NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The framework is divided into five core functions:

1. **Identify** → Audit systems, networks, and access policies to find vulnerabilities.  
2. **Protect** → Implement safeguards like MFA, firewalls, and IPS.  
3. **Detect** → Monitor anomalies with IDS, SIEM, and logging tools.  
4. **Respond** → Contain, neutralize, and communicate during incidents.  
5. **Recover** → Restore systems, data, and improve resilience.

##  How to Use

1. Review the **templates/** folder to start a new incident report.  
2. Document your findings in the **reports/** folder.  
3. Use **resources/** for reference and study support.  
4. Commit and push updates to GitHub to maintain your cybersecurity portfolio.
